# ToDoApp with JS

Small website to keep track of ToDos

Hello! In this README I will give a description of the project and explain how to use it.
This website is a frontend to my other project, ToDoApp (https://github.com/Samcolserra/ToDoApp), which is a backend that exposes a series of REST API calls. The frontend will not work without it.
