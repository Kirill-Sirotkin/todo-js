# ToDoApp with JS

Small website to keep track of ToDos

Hello! In this README I will give a description of the project and explain how to use it.

## **Section 1. Description**

This project has been done using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It allows a user to sign up or sign in, and then manage their ToDos on a website.
To create the project, debug and edit files VSCode application was used.
This website is a frontend to my other project, ToDoApp (https://github.com/Samcolserra/ToDoApp), which is a backend that exposes a series of REST API calls. The frontend will not work without it.

The website consists of 2 pages:
  1. Authentication page
  2. ToDo list page
